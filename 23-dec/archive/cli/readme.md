## Sync wiki folder

Add to `.env`

```
wikiFolderPath=path/to/wiki/
```

Where `wikiFolderPath` can link to the `seed` folder. If you ran `bun dev-setup` in root of project, you have [seed](https://github.com/learn-anything/seed) folder available. The path can then be something like:

```
wikiFolderPath=/Users/nikiv/src/learn-anything.xyz/seed/wiki/nikita
```
