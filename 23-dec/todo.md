## Public desktop app release

- use https://github.com/alxnddr/solid-monaco for editor
  - move all other text editor code to solid-ui repo
  - keep clean code, work with monaco as much as possible
- let users choose a folder of existing markdown files to sync with
- or allow choosing a folder where markdown files will be synced to
- load in all the .md files as topics and show in sidebar
- allow searching of topics
- allow editing of topics using CodeMirror
  - or Monaco editor, CodeMirror is cleanest (what Obsidian uses)
- loads all the desktop app state into SQLite
  - tauri/rust reads and writes from sqlite db. sqlite db is fully reactive
  - so if changes are made to files in the connected folder, sqlite db is updated with changes
  - likewise if changes are made to solid store state, it gets persisted to sqlite and also to the file system where needed
- public content
- global hotkey to add current link from safari/chrome using applescript (or some other way)
- search existing bookmarks with raycast

## Public user wikis

- all content published via desktop app, rendered as in [wiki.nikiv.dev](https://wiki.nikiv.dev)

## Mobile app release

- https://github.com/bndkt/sharemystack is great
- use [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) starter
  - ignite [seems best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOSvDlFyg20)
  - join their slack community too
- make sure hanko auth works well
- allow searching for topics
- take inspiration from [tamagui starters](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/starters)
- styling options
  - https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles
  - https://x.com/mark__lawlor/status/1710063049271279917
- consider using
  - https://github.com/peterpme/react-native-fast-text
- use https://x.com/sanketsahu/status/1712729417309626570?s=20

## Public website improvements

- hit Grafbase cache for most things where it makes sense
  - global guides, more?
- official topics should have verified badge

## GlobalLink improvements

- global links added should have `verified: false/true`
  - LA validates links that are non verified to make sure they have right metadata

## Analytics

- [Pirsch](https://github.com/pirsch-analytics/pirsch) is interesting

## Uses

- ability for users to share their stack of tools they use

## API access

- add API access to read/write to LA, guarded with [Unkey](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey) potentially

## DX

- annoying how when you do mobius query and then try to access stuff with `.data.publicGetGlobalTopic` for example, it's super unsafe
  - find a nice way to solve this

## Other

- if not editing guide sections inline, can highlight the section being edited when `section edit` slide window shows
- better web search using https://github.com/oramasearch/orama
- do proper observability and logging, especially on edgedb CRUD queries, make sure it can't fail for bad reasons, and if error happens, surface it to grafbase/users
- log all `console.error` with [TinyBird](https://www.tinybird.co) or [HyperDX](https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx)
- add multiplayer support using [tinybase/partykit](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1704879501232980298)
  - [many great tweets on it](https://twitter.com/jamespearce)
- allow importing of other people's bookmark presets (minus `private` bookmarks)
- get https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools working, specifically ability to select an element in browser and go to the component in code
- release all Figma to public
  - FigJam + Figma main design files
- `import { Motion } from "@motionone/solid"` always gives type trouble, don't get why
- replace fuse.js with orama in Search component. don't use fuse.js any more
- setup nice way to do `dump` and `restore` of a database
  - 2 separate commands
    - on `dump` will most likely move the `edgedb.db` into `private/` folder? so its git ignored. otherwise can git ignore for `*.db`
- setup nice way to bootstrap edgedb locally with content
  - read the seed folder and load things into edgedb
  - create global topic users can see with a guide editor fully working etc.
- maybe move to Vercel as there is more features than Pages
  - also can setup grafbase deploys on each branch with preview websites easily as grafbase natively supports it
  - otherwise need to use this api https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/pages-project-update-project
    - and on each branch created, setup preview deployment that will point to grafbase preview deploy URL
    - look at github webhooks and consume the preview url of Grafbase for each branch for grafbase test deploys
- have infinite login sessions with hanko ([how you can do it](https://discord.com/channels/788396090180894730/1161620915499565108/1161740380983795904))
- in grafbase, what do I do on success in resolvers?
  - do I return "success"?
- update tiptap editor in website to allow making links to other topics simiar to markdown links with `../topic.md` syntax. show a popover with search over topics
  - should be fast to edit topic guides
- remove non used packages in all package.json (there is tool that helps with this)
- pressing on section in right sidebar of global topic, should jump/scroll to section
- make all resolvers be `try catch (err)`, then show error via GraphQLError(error)
- all `catch (err)`
  - should log to baselime
  - actually log every useful log to baselime!
- wrap around mobius and show a pill or toast when error happens with any of the grafbase requests
  - this way you can just do queries to grafbase and error showing is fully abstracted and nice
- replace `npx grafbase@latest dev` with `bunx grafbase@latest dev`. [issue with bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/5552). reach out to help resolve it
- run command to remove non used package.json deps
  - there was github repo that did this well
