# Old Learn Anything

This is most recent archived version of LA. It's using Jazz but it has code using Remix and also has code for mobile app.

As focus of LA now is to make web version work well, it's here for reference as the code in [github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz) is made work well.

## Setup

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is used to run/install things.

```
bun i
```

We use [Jazz](https://jazz.tools/) for all global/local state management.

> [!NOTE]
> Things are still being worked on, but you can try run website, ask for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bxtD8x6aNF) if something is failing

```
bun setup
```

## Run website

```
bun web
```
