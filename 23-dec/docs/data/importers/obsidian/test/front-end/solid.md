# [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)

Love Solid. Has [best parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB5jK-KeXOs) of [React](react.md).

[Fine grained reactivity](https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf) is nice.

## Notes

- [Solid will never "re-render" your component/function.](https://twitter.com/Axibord1/status/1606106151539687425)
  - Means you don't ever have to optimise re-renders.
  - And don't have to fight with React useEffect.
- [Solid Dev Tools](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools) are great.
- createResource makes a signal out of a promise.
- Builin components like [For](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#for) and [Show](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#show) are great.
- [Biggest difference between React and Solid is that things that can change are wrapped in signals in Solid, and in dependencies arrays in React.](https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1528537000504184834)
