# Python libraries

[atoti](https://github.com/atoti/project-template), [Cookiecutter Poetry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry) & [AllenAI](https://github.com/allenai/python-package-template) templates seem nice. [Robyn](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn) seems like a nice web library.

Like idea of using Python as glue language for compiled modules like [Rust](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn) or [Zig](https://github.com/adamserafini/zaml).

[Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) is interesting for writing parallel math heavy code.

I use [Rye](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye) as way to manage dependencies.

## Notes

- [But Pandas clicked for me when I realized that Pandas methods output is usually either a pd.Series or a pd.DataFrame . Then, it's just a matter of integrating Pandas code with the wider Python ecosystem.](https://twitter.com/JacopoAttolini/status/1517655551328587776)
