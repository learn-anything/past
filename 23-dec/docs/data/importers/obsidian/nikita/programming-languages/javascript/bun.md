# [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Use Bun for running all my [TS](../typescript/typescript.md) code.

[Deno](../../web/deno.md) has interesting ideas too.

I never use [Node](../../web/nodejs/index.md) now as Bun is faster and has nicer dev on ramp if I want to contribute.

[Bun Docs](https://bun.sh/docs) are great. I love using [bunx](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/bunx) for running binaries without installing first.

[Elysia](https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia) is nice web framework although I prefer [Hono](https://hono.dev/).

Wish someone ported [dax](https://github.com/dsherret/dax) to Bun.
