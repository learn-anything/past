# Questions

- when to use `type` when to use `interface`
  - in theory `interface` is when you want to extend something, types are harder to extend?
  - what should default be? need to pick one and stick to it, annoying to have both `type` and `interface`..
  - current thinking is to default to `type` until it breaks down (then use interface)
