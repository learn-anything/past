# Notes

- Text editor once used [Solid CodeMirror](https://github.com/riccardoperra/solid-codemirror). Similar to [CodeImage project](https://github.com/riccardoperra/codeimage). But there were issues in making it work nicely. So now [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) is used.
- [Inlang](https://github.com/inlang/inlang), [CodeImage](https://github.com/riccardoperra/codeimage), [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) have great code to take inspiration from.
  - [Inlang's tech stack](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/blob/main/rfcs/tech-stack/RFC.md) specifically is very great.
