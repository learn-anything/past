# DevOps

Current setup is that all commits that land on `dev` will go to [dev.learn-anything.xyz](https://dev.learn-anything.xyz). Any commits that land on [main](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz/tree/main) will go to production at [learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz)
